What Can I Cook - Xamarin IOS version

This is a basic readme for this Xamarin IOS version of What Can I Cook, initially being created for Deakin subject SIT313.

To date, very basic functionality and user interface exists, and this is a fork of the original Android app that is in active development and has been published already: https://github.com/stevecrossin/What-Can-I-Cook-Android

At present, currently the app has several screens:

* Home page - allows navigation to screens to add ingredients, select dietary preferences and view the users pantry. At the moment, only passing of strings via segue exist. No data storage exists in the application at this time. Constraints at present are only partially working, and images have been developed for different screen orientations.

Developing a full-featured application in Xamarin.IOS will be the objective of Assignment 2, and I will be working on this with two other students - Brendon Binks and Michael Inati.

Images in the app are either under a free license, or has been purchased under commercial license. All details are in licences.txt inside the WhatCanICook folder.
