# What-Can-I-Cook-Xamarin


This is a basic readme for this Xamarin.Forms version of What Can I Cook, initially being created for Deakin subject SIT313.

This is a fork of the original Android app that is in active development and has been published already.: https://github.com/stevecrossin/What-Can-I-Cook-Android

This app is now fully functional.

At present, currently the app has several screens:

* Home page - allows navigation to screens to add ingredients, select dietary preferences and view the users pantry. 
* Dietary preferences - fully functional
* Pantry - fully functional.
* Facebook Login - Fully functional
* Recipes - webview, custom Google Search. Fully functional.

App fully functional!

Developing a full-featured application in Xamarin.IOS will be the objective of Assignment 2, and I will be working on this with three other students - Brendon Binks, Jess Fitzgerald and Michael Inati.
